      "Dr. Jordan Wolff is a second-generation chiropractor practicing in the same Midtown Manhattan office his father opened 40 years ago. Adjusted from birth, he shares why chiropractic is a way of life — not just pain relief. He talks about real patient transformations happening daily, why every pregnant woman and baby should be adjusted, and the full-circle moment of adjusting his daughter in the delivery room.",
